## The cmd challenge

In this project, we were tasked to complete 27 challenges from the [CMD Challenge](https://cmdchallenge.com/). Which is a challenge that requires basic to intermediate knowledge in bash linux to solve them.


I have done 30 of the challenges as you can see in the screenshot ***2-next_9_tasks.png***.

I don't think it is appropriate to just share the answer on this read me, but i will list almost every thing I used to do the challengs.

List of the commands I have used:
* `find`
* `grep`
* `sed`
* `echo`
* `let`
* `rename`
* `xargs`
* `ls`
* `ln`
* `tr`
* `wc`
* `dirname`
* `uniq`

Also some concepts that I needed to have a grasp to complete the challenges include:
* *for loop in linux bash*
* *linux shell variables*
* *basic regex*


I believe that's it!
